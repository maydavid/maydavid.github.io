<p>
My name is David May. Since 2011, I am a PhD student at the Technische Universität München
<img src="/img/tum_logo.png" height="15">
, in Munich, Germany at the <a href="http://lis.ei.tum.de">Institute for Integrated System</a> of Prof. Herkersdorf. There, I am <a href="">working</a> on novel approaches to substantially decrease the power consumption of future CMOS devices.
</p>
<p>In 2010, I finished my studies in electrical engineering at the Institute for Communications Engineering (Prof. Kötter) also at the TUM. During my studies I had 2 stays abroad at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics at the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/RohdeSchwarz-Referencelaboratory">Rohde & Schwarz Reference Laboratory</a>. There, I also wrote my Diploma thesis about the design and implementation of a software-defined DAB+ receiver.

In my spare time I am mostly occupied with my hobbies: Sport, Music and my VW T3 Camper. My private projects are mainly dedicated to make my life easier. From <a href="">wireless environment sensing at home</a> via <a href="">energy management in my camper</a> to a <a href="">solar-powered handcart</a> for summer-trips to the Isar - If something is panted in to my mind, it will be done.
