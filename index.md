My name is David May. Since 2011, I am a PhD student at the Technische Universität München
<img src="/img/tum_logo.png" height="15">
, in Munich, Germany at the [Institute for Integrated System](http://lis.ei.tum.de) of Prof. Herkersdorf. There, I am [working](/research.html) on novel approaches to substantially decrease the power consumption of future CMOS devices.

In 2010, I finished my studies in electrical engineering at the Institute for Communications Engineering (Prof. Kötter) also at the TUM. During my studies I had 2 stays abroad at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics at the [Rohde & Schwarz Reference Laboratory](https://www.facebook.com/pages/RohdeSchwarz-Referencelaboratory/262903123770686). There, I also wrote my Diploma thesis about the design and implementation of a software-defined DAB+ receiver.

In my spare time I am mostly occupied with my hobbies: Sport, Music and my VW T3 Camper. My private projects are mainly dedicated to make my life easier. From [wireless environment sensing at home](/wirelesshome.html) via [energy management in my camper](/buscontrol.html) to a [solar-powered handcart](/bollo3k.html) for summer-trips to the Isar - If something is panted in to my mind, it will be done.
